There will be four blocks of 32 trials.
Feel free to abort the experiment at any time by pressing the escape button.
Keep fixating at the middle marker as long as it is on the screen.
The shape of the fixation marker helps remember the cued image (face: '+', house 'x').
Out of the two superimposed images on top of the fixation marker, attend to the one that appeared before the trial began.
If the cued image tilted, press the spacebar.
If the cued image did not titled, do nothing.
A colored circle at the end of each trial shows if the response was correc (green) or wrong (red).
