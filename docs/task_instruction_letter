=================================================
[1] There will be four blocks of 32 trials.
[2] Feel free to abort the experiment at any time by pressing the backspace
button.
[3] Keep fixating at the marker (+/X) as long as it is on the screen.
[4] The shape of the fixation marker helps remember the cued image (face: '+',
house 'x').
[5] Out of the two superimposed images on top of the fixation marker, attend to
 the one that appeared before the trial began.
[6] If the cued image tilted, press the insert/0 button.
[7] If the cued image did not tilt, press no key.
[8] A coloured circle will appear at the end of the trial that shows how well
you performed in the current trial. (green - well done, orange - you can do
better, red - please be more careful).
